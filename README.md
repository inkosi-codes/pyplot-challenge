## Overview
Using Python libraries Matplotlib and Pandas analyze drug treatments given to a group of mice with SCC tumor growth.
Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. You have been tasked by the executive team to generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study. 

## Charts and Analysis Include
* Boxplot
* Bar Charts - Showing mice per Drug Regimen
* Pie Chart - Showing Distribution amoung the sex of the mice
